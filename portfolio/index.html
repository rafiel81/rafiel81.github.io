          If love is love no matter what, then my mission is clear: to use media

          of love — loudly, proudly, and unapologetically.

        My journey to RMIT has been shaped by five projects and clubs that

        <span class="text-bold text-italic text-lavender" data-scroll-reveal
          >wedding planning</span

        Turning love into practice
      </h3>
      <h3>
        My internship at An An Media & Communications was a turning point—where
        I applied love, storytelling, and care to real-world communication. I
        co-led event campaigns, supported press operations, and built a fanpage
        strategy from planning to rollout.

        Over three months, I gained hands-on experience in market analysis,
        media risk, and brand messaging while actively learning from
        professionals and self-study. This role didn’t just sharpen my
        professional skills—it clarified my path forward.
